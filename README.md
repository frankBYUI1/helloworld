# Overview

I'm currently working on different projects like web apps, mobile apps and machine learning to be able to expand my knowledge and also to get experience on things I did not try it before probably because I was too scare or I was not that confident on my skills as a programmer.

I am currently working on a macbook pro and using visual studio code as my main IDE. But I have experience using rider, pycharm, atom, arduino IDE, Jupyter Notebook and AWS Cloud9.
